    <h3>Hi, my name is Jacob Wolniewicz!</h3>

    <p>
        I'm a developer that tries to build software for a better tomorrow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mountain addict - brewer - tin foil hat computer scientist - board game geek - instrument tinkerer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am a software engineer who started at Microsoft where I learned practices to build software that lasts. Now I work as a tech lead
      at different companies around Boulder Colorado. When not working I volunteer in the outdoor industry, make beer, play games, and fiddle around with instruments.
      Currently bagpipes and the piano are my focus.

    <p>I sit and think about data and how humans interact with computers.</p>

    <p>
      Every now and then I publish a blog post about recent interactions or thoughts I've had.
      Please look at my <a href="https://medium.com/@jacobwolniewicz">Medium Blog</a> for more.

    <p>
      I'm always happy to hear new thoughts, and talk to others about accessibility. Please feel free to contact me

    <p>
      I am passionate about the outdoors, their protection, and teaching others safe techniques to travel.
      In 2017 through the end of 2018 I was the chair of the Seattle Mountaineers climbing committee. I have been the head instructor on courses around
      multi pitch trad climbing, glacier travel, and intro to rock climbing courses. I have also been an assistant instructor
      for AIARE 1 at the Mountaineers. I currently am leading a course on Multi Pitch Trad climbing scheduled for May 2018.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that I live in Boulder I have began helping the Colorado Mountain Club on their climbing courses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Growing up in Colorado I would hike 14ers and camp.
      When I moved to Washington I wanted to keep getting up peaks but quickly learned that the higher gradiant of their peaks demanded
      I learn how to climb. Hence my outdoor climbing career began.
